                     <p>Play therapy may be non-directive (where the child decides what to do in a session, within safe boundaries) or directive (where the therapist leads the way) or a mixture of the two. It is particularly effective with children who cannot, or do not want to talk about their problems.</p>
                     <p>Play Therapy is suitable for children aged from 3 years of age and there is no one too old who will not benefit from the creative arts!</p>

                       <p>Environmental Art Therapy is when we bring our therapy sessions out into nature. <br>Nature has a way of giving us what we need at any given time. Being out in its wildness and its absolute beauty reminds us of how insignificant we are in the greater scheme of things and what seems like an insurmountable obstacle is actually manageable if seen from another perspective.</p>
                       <p>RW Kimmerer (2013) describes how trees are teachers of healing. Despite all the damage we inflict on mother nature she does not turn her back on us but instead is constantly there for us. Elements in nature understand their interconnectedness. Life of one is dependent on the life of all. As a culture we have moved so far from what is natural and we are hurting as a result.</p>
                       <p>Nature also lends itself to ritual and in its rhythms (the seasons, the tides, the winds etc) and seasonal changes we are reminded of our own losses and subsequent growth or decay. Fires can be lit, altars created, dens built, we can just walk and reflect on our loss. Having a witness, makes the sense of ritual more profound. Rituals and their embodied experience enable people to make meaning from their loss and to honour it. There is healing in that sense of ‘doing something’. Rituals allow for the processing of difficult feelings in a way that is safely contained. </p>
